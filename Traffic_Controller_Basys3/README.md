## Traffic Light Control for T-Junction (Code and Road Explanation)

This code controls a traffic light system for a T-junction with two roads:

* **Main Road (Highway):** A major road with potentially higher traffic volume.
* **Side Road (Farm Road):** A minor road with potentially lower traffic volume.

**Here's a breakdown of the code and how it relates to the road situation:**

**Code:**

1. **States:** The code uses four states to represent different traffic light phases:
    * `HGRE_FRED`: Main road green, Side road red (Initial state)
    * `HYEL_FRED`: Main road yellow (transition), Side road red
    * `HRED_FGRE`: Main road red, Side road green
    * `HRED_FYEL`: Main road red, Side road yellow (transition)
2. **Sensor:** The `C` input represents a sensor on the side road that detects vehicles waiting.
3. **Timers:** The code uses counters to generate delays for the yellow lights (`YELLOW_count_en1` and `YELLOW_count_en2`) and the red light on the main road (`RED_count_en`).
4. **Light Outputs:** The `light_highway` and `light_farm` outputs control the actual traffic lights, assigning values that correspond to red (1), yellow (2), and green (4) for each road.

**Road Behavior:**

1. **Initial State:** The main road has a green light, allowing traffic to flow. The side road has a red light, and vehicles must wait.
2. **Vehicle Detection on Side Road:** When a vehicle is present on the side road and activates the sensor (`C` input), the system initiates a change.
3. **Main Road Yellow:** The main road light changes to yellow (`HYEL_FRED` state) for a short duration (3 seconds) to warn drivers of an upcoming change.
4. **Main Road Red, Side Road Green:** The main road light turns red (`HRED_FGRE` state), allowing traffic on the main road to stop safely. Simultaneously, the side road light switches to green, allowing the waiting vehicle(s) to enter the main road.
5. **Side Road Yellow (Optional):** After a set time (10 seconds, depending on the code configuration), the side road light might change to yellow (`HRED_FYEL` state) for another short duration (3 seconds) as a courtesy before switching back to red.
6. **Back to Main Road Green:** The system eventually cycles back to the initial state (`HGRE_FRED`), with a green light for the main road and a red light for the side road.

**Key Points:**

* This design prioritizes traffic flow on the main road but allows controlled access for vehicles entering from the side road when the sensor detects them.
* The sensor ensures the side road light doesn't turn green unless a vehicle is waiting, reducing unnecessary green phases.

**In summary, the code effectively controls the traffic lights at a T-junction, ensuring smooth traffic flow on the main road while providing controlled access for vehicles entering from the side road.**
