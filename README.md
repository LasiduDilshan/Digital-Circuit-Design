# Digital-Circuit-Design 

This repository contains a collection of digital circuit designs implemented in Verilog and Tcl. The projects include:

- **D Flip Flop:** A basic memory element for storing a single bit.
- **Decoder 4x16:** A 4-to-16 line decoder.
- **Encoder 16bit:** A 16-bit encoder.
- **Gray Code Counter:** A counter that generates Gray code sequences.
- **Traffic Controller:** A traffic light control system designed for the FPGA board.
- **UART:** Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter for serial communication.

    **Tools**

    * Hardware Description Language (HDL): Verilog
    * Simulator: ModelSim
    * Synthesis and Place-and-Route: Intel Quartus Prime (or Altera Quartus II)

Each project includes Verilog source files and relevant testbenches. These designs can be used as resources or as a basis for more complex digital design projects.
