## Explanation of the Verilog Module `d_ff`

This Verilog module defines a D Flip-Flop (D FF) with an enable signal. Here's a breakdown:

* **`timescale 1ns / 1ps`:** This line sets the simulation timescale. Although not directly related to the D FF functionality, it defines the unit of time for clock and delay simulations (1 nanosecond for clock and 1 picosecond for delays).

* **Module Ports:**
    * `clk (input)`: This is the clock signal that triggers the data capture.
    * `d (input)`: This is the data bit to be stored in the flip-flop.
    * `en (input)`: This is the enable signal. When active (`en` is high for most designs), the data on `d` is captured on the positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`). When inactive (low for most designs), the stored data remains unchanged.
    * `q (output reg)`: This is the registered output. It holds the data that was captured on the previous positive clock edge if the enable signal was active.

* **Always Block:**
    * The `always @(posedge clk)` statement defines a behavioral block that executes on every positive edge of the clock.
    * The `if (en)` statement checks if the enable signal is active.
    * If `en` is active, the `q <= d` statement assigns the current value of `d` to the output `q`. This capture happens only on the clock edge when the `if` condition is true.
    * If `en` is inactive, the value of `q` remains unchanged.

**In summary,** this D FF module allows you to store a data bit (`d`) on the positive edge of the clock (`clk`) only if the enable signal (`en`) is active. Otherwise, the stored data remains the same.
